Game Objective:
'Hall of Fame Hangman' is a simple word guess game. The goal is to correctly guess the last name of a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame, prior to running out of guesses.

How to Play:
1. Press any letter key to start guessing. Note: you will only be allowed to select letter keys
2. Correct guesses will be populated in the 'Current Name' section. Each guess will bring you closer to your goal
